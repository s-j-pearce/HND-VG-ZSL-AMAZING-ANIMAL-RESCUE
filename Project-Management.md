## I. Project Overview
We have been contracted by ZSL (Zoological Society of London) to design and produce an educational game based around the greenhouse gas chain for 4 different products, Plastic Bottles, Mobile Phones, Beef and Electronics that are left on stand-by. The game is to be used in classes the ZSL run at London Zoo for 11-16 year olds, the first of which will be run on the 14th November 2017. We will be having regular meetings with the client to collect feedback on our ideas and keep the client satisfied.

## II. First Client Meeting (2nd October 2017)
Our first meeting with the client involeed a representative from ZSL visiting us and giving a presentation about what they wanted us to create for them. The information given to us included:

## IV. Designing
### Concept Drawing:
|Explination:| Concept art:|
| -------------- | -------------- |
|The selection screen was a combined design as we all had the same idea for this screen, we wanted it to be simplistic as well as asphetically appealing. we wanted the player to be able to pick and choose from all 4 habitats and see a visual representation of each one.| ![selection screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/32996215-fbd55924-cd77-11e7-98f4-a6dcc7221d1f.PNG)|
|We originally wanted to have an animation once the player clicked on the habitat that they wanted to play. it was going to be a simple animation that would enlarge the graphic so you can see it clearer whilst loading the buttons which are added in the image below.|![animation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/32996235-249363f6-cd78-11e7-8528-a12bcf8fc81e.PNG)|
|As you can see from the image to the right, we wanted the habitat that you selected to enlarge enough to see more detail but we also wanted the player to still be able to see the other habitats under it. We did not want the selected habitat to take over the whole screen.|![habitat screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/32996250-48c0be0e-cd78-11e7-9f4e-9c4c17edfc6b.PNG)|

## V. Concept Pitch (17th October 2017)
For our concept pitch, we traveled to ZSL Whipsnade to meet with the client. Before the meeting we had created a short powerpoint presentation with an idea of how we visioned the game as well as a few concept art designs to show where we wanted each element to go. Once the presentation was over we asked for feedback and questions to help us improve our idea and vision for the game. Below is a list of the feedback we recieved after the presentation.

Noted feedback:
* Maze screen - want the chain to be the main feature/focus.
* Show the whole cycle of each product.
* Increase the difficulty of each maze.
* Appeal to younger and older(different graphic options).
* More detailed graphics(Rainforest).
* Two different settings for different ages.
* Want to see the full affect of the greenhouse gases.
* Dont make the maze the full focus.
* Come back to the maze after each chain.

As you can see from the feedback above, there were a few things that we needed to do straight away and a few things that were suggested that were not so important. The client suggested that we make the main focus the chain instead of the maze idea, this was the main focus that we had after the meeting. the other comments about the graphics and the setting for two different age options was more of a suggestion if we had time, this allowed us to fully focus on the chain concept and if we had time, we could possibly impliment the option for two different age groups.

## VI. Adapting to Feedback
Below we will break down each point of feedback and explain how we adapted our designs and ideas for the game:
1. "Maze screen - want the chain to be the main feature/focus" - After the presentation, we sat down and decided that it was best to remove the maze as a whole and make the chain the sole focus. By doing this it would dramatically reduce our work load as well as appeal more to what the client wants.
2. "Show the whole cycle of each product." - Like in the above point, we were able to reach this outcome by making the chain the main focus of the game, this then allowed us to include the full chain which is what the client wanted.
3. "Increase the difficulty of each maze." - Like the above two points, we completely removed the maze feature from the game which means this point no longer applies to the game.
4. "Appeal to younger and older(different graphic options)." - We decided to leave this point to be one of the last things to work on as the client said they would like the option for this however it was not mandatory to do so.
5. "More detailed graphics(Rainforest)." - After the presentation we worked to changing the rainforest graphic to make it look more realistic and belivable. This was a very straightfoward task and did not require each member to work on so it was done quickly by one member whilst the others worked on implimenting other features.
6. "Two different settings for different ages." - This feedback is basically the fourth point where the client suggested that we make a option to change the graphics depending on the age of the players. we put this at the bottom of our priorities because like mentioned above, it was only a suggestion not a mandatory feature.
7. "Want to see the full affect of the greenhouse gases." - We planned to have the graphic elements of the game change as they completed the chain. This would have provided a visual representation of how the affects of each stage change our planet which would hopefully trigger a realisation for the player.
8. "Dont make the maze the full focus." - Like in the first point, we completly removed the maze so that we could make the chain the main focus, this would in turn get the message to the player quicker and more efficently.
9. "Come back to the maze after each chain." - We had the idea to possibly incorperate the maze back in the game if we had time however we did not get around to doing so as we felt the chain provided the correct amount of play time for each habitat.
