## I. Project Overview
We have been contracted by ZSL (Zoological Society of London) to design and produce an educational game based around the greenhouse gas chain for 4 different products, Plastic Bottles, Mobile Phones, Beef and Electronics that are left on stand-by. The game is to be used in classes the ZSL run at London Zoo for 11-16 year olds, the first of which will be run on the 14th November 2017. We will be having regular meetings with the client to collect feedback on our ideas and keep the client satisfied.

## II. First Client Meeting (2nd October 2017)
Our first meeting with the client involeed a representative from ZSL visiting us and giving a presentation about what they wanted us to create for them. The information given to us included:

## IV. Designing
### Concept Drawing:
|Explination:| Concept art:|
| -------------- | -------------- |
|The selection screen was a combined design as we all had the same idea for this screen, we wanted it to be simplistic as well as asphetically appealing. we wanted the player to be able to pick and choose from all 4 habitats and see a visual representation of each one.| ![selection screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/32996215-fbd55924-cd77-11e7-98f4-a6dcc7221d1f.PNG)|
|We originally wanted to have an animation once the player clicked on the habitat that they wanted to play. it was going to be a simple animation that would enlarge the graphic so you can see it clearer whilst loading the buttons which are added in the image below.|![animation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/32996235-249363f6-cd78-11e7-8528-a12bcf8fc81e.PNG)|

| -------------- | -------------- |:----------------:|
| As you can see from the image above, the only real change was the top left graphic as the client felt that it was not a true representation of how the real habitat looks like.| ![zsl-habitat-screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/32994252-61a2f278-cd5c-11e7-8b80-32b72ada6740.png)| ![zsl-habitat-screen-final](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/32994333-7f63159e-cd5d-11e7-8dee-876b6980ff36.png)|
