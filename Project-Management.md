## I. Project Overview
We have been contracted by ZSL (Zoological Society of London) to design and produce an educational game based around the greenhouse gas chain for 4 different products, Plastic Bottles, Mobile Phones, Beef and Electronics that are left on stand-by. The game is to be used in classes the ZSL run at London Zoo for 11-16 year olds, the first of which will be run on the 14th November 2017.
