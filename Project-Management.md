## I. Project Overview
We have been contracted by ZSL (Zoological Society of London) to design and produce an educational game based around the greenhouse gas chain for 4 different products, Plastic Bottles, Mobile Phones, Beef and Electronics that are left on stand-by. The game is to be used in classes the ZSL run at London Zoo for 11-16 year olds, the first of which will be run on the 14th November 2017. We will be having regular meetings with the client to collect feedback on our ideas and keep the client satisfied.

## II. First Client Meeting (2nd October 2017)
Our first meeting with the client involeed a representative from ZSL visiting us and giving a presentation about what they wanted us to create for them. The information given to us included:

## IV. Designing
### Concept Drawing:
|Explination:| Concept art:|
| -------------- | -------------- |
|The selection screen was a combined design as we all had the same idea for this screen, we wanted it to be simplistic as well as asphetically appealing. we wanted the player to be able to pick and choose from all 4 habitats and see a visual representation of each one.| ![selection screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/32996215-fbd55924-cd77-11e7-98f4-a6dcc7221d1f.PNG)|
|We originally wanted to have an animation once the player clicked on the habitat that they wanted to play. it was going to be a simple animation that would enlarge the graphic so you can see it clearer whilst loading the buttons which are added in the image below.|![animation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/32996235-249363f6-cd78-11e7-8528-a12bcf8fc81e.PNG)|
|As you can see from the image to the right, we wanted the habitat that you selected to enlarge enough to see more detail but we also wanted the player to still be able to see the other habitats under it. We did not want the selected habitat to take over the whole screen.|![habitat screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/32996250-48c0be0e-cd78-11e7-9f4e-9c4c17edfc6b.PNG)|

## V. Concept Pitch (17th October 2017)
For our concept pitch, we traveled to ZSL Whipsnade to meet with the client. Before the meeting we had created a short powerpoint presentation with an idea of how we visioned the game as well as a few concept art designs to show where we wanted each element to go. Once the presentation was over we asked for feedback and questions to help us improve our idea and vision for the game. Below is a list of the feedback we recieved after the presentation.

Noted feedback:
* Maze screen - want the chain to be the main feature/focus.
* Show the whole cycle of each product.
* Increase the difficulty of each maze.
* Appeal to younger and older(different graphic options).
* More detailed graphics(Rainforest).
* Two different settings for different ages.
* Want to see the full affect of the greenhouse gases.
* Dont make the maze the full focus.
* Come back to the maze after each chain.

## VI. Adapting to Feedback
### Designs:

| -------------- | -------------- |:----------------:|
| As you can see from the image above, the only real change was the top left graphic as the client felt that it was not a true representation of how the real habitat looks like.| ![zsl-habitat-screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/32994252-61a2f278-cd5c-11e7-8b80-32b72ada6740.png)| ![zsl-menu-final](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/33014287-beb31e0c-cdde-11e7-985c-0ba86f1f630b.png)|
