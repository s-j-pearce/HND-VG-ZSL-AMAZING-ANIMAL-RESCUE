# HND-VG-ZSL-AMAZING-ANIMAL-RESCUE
# Design Documentation

## I. Introduction

In this game, the player(s) aim is to uncover facts and information that is hidden underneath a row of 'cards'. The player must move these cards and put them in order on a different row in order to reveal the hidden information. The game is being designed and made for ZSL and as such, the information included on and underneath the cards is to do with the greenhouse gas chain for 4 different products (Plastic bottles, Mobile Phones, Beef, and Electronics being left on standby) and the cards themselves are each step of the chain.

## II. Game Objective

The objective/purpose of this game is to teach children aged 11-16 about the steps that go in to making each of the 4 products, and raise awareness about how much greenhouse gas is produced. The game will also tell the player(s) how they can help to reduce the ammount of greenhouse gasses released.

## III. Genre

The game is a 2D, top down, educational puzzle solving game.

## VI. Features

- 2D Top Down
- Interactive
- Educational
- Web Based
- Tocuh Screen Support

## V. Platform

The game will be built as a web based app. This means that any device that has a compatable browser installed will be able to play the game. However, as requested by ZSL, the game will be optimised to run on iPad devices for use in their classes.

## Included Text

This section will detail what text is to be included in the game.

All the text shown here will be placed on the cards that the player has to drag and drop into the correct order. Each card will contain one step. The first and last steps of the chain will be already in place for the players to give them somewhere to begin.

# Project Management Documentation
##### Mark Biswell, Sam Pearce, Ryan Edwards & George Haughton

## I. Project Overview
We have been contracted by ZSL (Zoological Society of London) to design and produce an educational game based around the greenhouse gas chain for 4 different products, Plastic Bottles, Mobile Phones, Beef and Electronics that are left on stand-by. The game is to be used in classes the ZSL run at London Zoo for 11-16 year olds, the first of which will be run on the 14th November 2017. We will be having regular meetings with the client to collect feedback on our ideas and keep the client satisfied.
#### Aims:
* To create a fun game
* To make it interactive
* To educate the students
* To raise awareness
#### Objectives:
1. To finish the Design documentation by Monday 16th October 2017
2. To finish all of the proposal documentation by monday 16th October 2017
3. To finish the development and building of the game by Sunday 29th October 2017
4. To make sure the game has been tested and is ready for shipping to the clinet by Monday 6th November 2017
#### User and software Requirements:
* Educational game
* Fun and interactive game
* Multi-user friendly
* simplistic/intuitive interface
* Child friendly
* Short and sweet
* Compatible with an Ipad
### Cost:
There were a few things in relation to cost in order to complete the project. 
* The first thing we will look at is time, as we were working for free the cost for our time equates to £0.
* The second thing that 'cost' money is the systems used. in order for us to develp the system effectivly, we needed to have a system that could withstand our needs/requirements. The systems that we used at college are around £1500 including the screens and peripherals. This so far brings our cost to £6000 as there were 4 of us in a group.
* The next cost is software. The main software used to develop the game itself was **Unit**, unity cost around £130 per person for a pro license, this means that unity cost £520 for the 4 of us to all develop the game. The next software that we used was photoshop, photoshop is part of adobe, in order to gain acces to adobe's applications you need to pay around £40 a month, this means that photoshop cost around £480, this is for 4 people over the course of 3 months.
* Another cost is internet, as we were developing the game at college, we would not be able to find out the cost of the internet.
* The final cost is travel, as we used a minibus to get from college to ZSL we do not know exactly how much it cost to hire out the minibus for the needed trips and time.
### Scope:
For this project we wanted to greate a fun interactive game that was designed for the required age range. as we had a very limited time to build and develop the game we needed to make things a lot more simpler in order to meet the deadline as well as stay in the scope of the project. There were a few things that we wanted to do that we know we did not have enough time or skill to impliment in time:
* Mulitplayer capabilities
* Social media connections
* A Competetive scoring system
* Review system for scores
As these were a few ideas that we had in place we had to sub them out and change them to fit the scope, this meant that we had to make these changes:
* The game would not be multiplayer, however multiple people could take it in turns to have a go
* The game would not be connected to any social media due to limitations and security issues
* The scoring system would have to be done manually, the teams would just have to work together to beat the game the fastest
* Once the students have completed the game they would have to advice the teacher or staff their time in order to compete against the other groups/teams.
### Time:
We had around 5 weeks in total to complete the project. We had just over 2 weeks to complete all of the required design documentation. Within the first 2 weeks we also needed to complete a proposal to demonstrate and show the client our idea. The 3rd and 4th week were used for the development and construction of the application and the last week was used for testing and finalizing the application.
### Quality:
As the project was for a serious client with a need to use for actual consumers, the quality needed to be high quality and nothing less. Throughout the development process we worked to make sure that the application came across as professional and looked high quality.
### Communication:
Throughout the project it was imperetive that we had good communication whilst creating the application. from the design documentation to the testing phase, we needed to make sure that we all kept up to date with each other in order to stay on the same page, this helped the project come along as we all knew what the ideal outcome or finished project was.
### Risk:
The risk of this project is reputation, as it was our first client we needed to make a good lasting impression for them so that they would want to work with us again in the future. having a a good reputation for a first project could also pave the way for other clients to come in and want to work with us so it was imperative that we did a good job.
### Resources:
There were a number of resources needed to complete the project, below is a list of the resources:
* System/Pc to develop on
* Internet Access
* Unity pro
* Adobe(photoshop)
* Microsoft Office (PowerPoint, Word, Excel)
## II. First Client Meeting (2nd October 2017)
Our first meeting with the client involeed a representative from ZSL visiting us and giving a presentation about what they wanted us to create for them. The information given to us included:

## III. Schedule/Plan

### Work Breakdown structure:
#### What are epics and user stories:
##### Epics:
A Scrum epic is basically a larger user story. It can also be described as a big chunk of work that has one common objective. It could be a feature, customer request or business requirement. It is the bigger picture of something. For instance, with ZSL they came to us and asked us to design and build an interactive application which will help educate students on the affect we are having on the green house gas chain. Now we can take that request and turn it into a couple of epics, for example "As a user i want to be able to learn about the affects i have on the greenhouse gas chain in this application" now from that epic we can then break that down further to give us what are known as user stories.
##### User stories:
A user story is simply something a user wants. However think of these stories as going towards an overall goal. For instance when we discussed epics above we said how the client came to us and said "design and build an interactive application which will help educate students on the affect we are having on the green house gas chain". We took what they asked and turned it into a epic which was "As a user i want to be able to learn about the affects i have on the greenhouse gas chain in this application". From that epic we can break that down into more managable tasks or 'User stories'. As an example, we could create a user story which states "As a user i would like to see what affect im having". Now if we translate that to a task, it would look something like this: Make an interactive page where the user is shown how much greenhouse gas they make by using specific items. By breaking down the epics into smaller scaled user stories we can manage these tasks and make the workload easier.
##### Below is a graphical representation of the agile method:

* As a user i would like to be given cool facts as i use the app
* As a user i want to be able to know how i can make a change
* As a user i want to see lots of images and not just text
##### 4. (To raise awareness):
* As a user i would like to be able to say how im going to make a change
* As a user i would like to be able to pledge to make a difference
* As a user i would like to know what affect im having on the animals 
* As a user i would like to know what affect im having on the planet
* As a user i would like to be able to see how i can change the green house gas affect
## IV. Designing
### Concept Drawing:
|Explination:| Concept art:|
| -------------- | -------------- |
|The selection screen was a combined design as we all had the same idea for this screen, we wanted it to be simplistic as well as asphetically appealing. we wanted the player to be able to pick and choose from all 4 habitats and see a visual representation of each one.| ![selection screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/32996215-fbd55924-cd77-11e7-98f4-a6dcc7221d1f.PNG)|
|We originally wanted to have an animation once the player clicked on the habitat that they wanted to play. it was going to be a simple animation that would enlarge the graphic so you can see it clearer whilst loading the buttons which are added in the image below.|![animation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/32996235-249363f6-cd78-11e7-8528-a12bcf8fc81e.PNG)|
|As you can see from the image to the right, we wanted the habitat that you selected to enlarge enough to see more detail but we also wanted the player to still be able to see the other habitats under it. We did not want the selected habitat to take over the whole screen.|![habitat screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/32996250-48c0be0e-cd78-11e7-9f4e-9c4c17edfc6b.PNG)|

## V. Concept Pitch (17th October 2017)
For our concept pitch, we traveled to ZSL Whipsnade to meet with the client. Before the meeting we had created a short powerpoint presentation with an idea of how we visioned the game as well as a few concept art designs to show where we wanted each element to go. Once the presentation was over we asked for feedback and questions to help us improve our idea and vision for the game. Below is a list of the feedback we recieved after the presentation.

Noted feedback:
* Maze screen - want the chain to be the main feature/focus.
* Show the whole cycle of each product.
* Increase the difficulty of each maze.
* Appeal to younger and older(different graphic options).
* More detailed graphics(Rainforest).
* Two different settings for different ages.
* Want to see the full affect of the greenhouse gases.
* Dont make the maze the full focus.
* Come back to the maze after each chain.

As you can see from the feedback above, there were a few things that we needed to do straight away and a few things that were suggested that were not so important. The client suggested that we make the main focus the chain instead of the maze idea, this was the main focus that we had after the meeting. the other comments about the graphics and the setting for two different age options was more of a suggestion if we had time, this allowed us to fully focus on the chain concept and if we had time, we could possibly impliment the option for two different age groups.

## VI. Adapting to Feedback
Below we will break down each point of feedback and explain how we adapted our designs and ideas for the game:
1. "Maze screen - want the chain to be the main feature/focus" - After the presentation, we sat down and decided that it was best to remove the maze as a whole and make the chain the sole focus. By doing this it would dramatically reduce our work load as well as appeal more to what the client wants.
2. "Show the whole cycle of each product." - Like in the above point, we were able to reach this outcome by making the chain the main focus of the game, this then allowed us to include the full chain which is what the client wanted.
3. "Increase the difficulty of each maze." - Like the above two points, we completely removed the maze feature from the game which means this point no longer applies to the game.
4. "Appeal to younger and older(different graphic options)." - We decided to leave this point to be one of the last things to work on as the client said they would like the option for this however it was not mandatory to do so.
5. "More detailed graphics(Rainforest)." - After the presentation we worked to changing the rainforest graphic to make it look more realistic and belivable. This was a very straightfoward task and did not require each member to work on so it was done quickly by one member whilst the others worked on implimenting other features.
6. "Two different settings for different ages." - This feedback is basically the fourth point where the client suggested that we make a option to change the graphics depending on the age of the players. we put this at the bottom of our priorities because like mentioned above, it was only a suggestion not a mandatory feature.
7. "Want to see the full affect of the greenhouse gases." - We planned to have the graphic elements of the game change as they completed the chain. This would have provided a visual representation of how the affects of each stage change our planet which would hopefully trigger a realisation for the player.
8. "Dont make the maze the full focus." - Like in the first point, we completly removed the maze so that we could make the chain the main focus, this would in turn get the message to the player quicker and more efficently.
9. "Come back to the maze after each chain." - We had the idea to possibly incorperate the maze back in the game if we had time however we did not get around to doing so as we felt the chain provided the correct amount of play time for each habitat.


### Visual adaptions:
| Habitat selction screen:               | Before Feedback:        | After Feedback:           |
| -------------- | -------------- |:----------------:|
| As you can see from the images to the right, the only real change was the top right graphic as the client felt that it was not a true representation of how the real habitat looks like.| ![zsl-habitat-screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/32994252-61a2f278-cd5c-11e7-8b80-32b72ada6740.png)| ![zsl-menu-final](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/33014287-beb31e0c-cdde-11e7-985c-0ba86f1f630b.png)|

| Rainforest graphic:               | Before Feedback:        | After Feedback:           |
| -------------- | -------------- |:----------------:|
| Like above, the rainforest graphic was the main change of the visual elements, the client said that it was too unrealistic as it did not look dense enough. To improve the overall look of this graphic we increased the density by downloading a few free brushes which allowed us to get a better looking design.| ![zsl-jungle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/33013646-a70ff466-cddc-11e7-90c0-39b75b71b5a6.png)| ![zsl-jungle-recovered](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/33013662-c0e8f7fc-cddc-11e7-8954-cce5c5a0d505.jpg)|

| Game Screen:               | Before Feedback:        | After Feedback:           |
| -------------- | -------------- |:----------------:|
| With the original concept art we felt that it looked a little too cartoony. With the major change being the removal of the maze we decided to make the elements appeal to the client more, in order to do so we needed to add a lot more information on the screena about the chain.| ![zsl-game-screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/33013769-13a112ea-cddd-11e7-9a8e-c43e99f727f8.png)| ![zsl-ocean-game-screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/33014075-eacb21f2-cddd-11e7-9020-0d18243f677f.png)|
